# Seminar
A university 3rd year seminar about using personalization to ease the life of users.
This seminar was presented in May 2022 under Osher Yadgar in BIU.

I paraphrased, edited, explained and presented the technical portions of the paper we were presenting. It involved researching material online, crossing information from other related papers and papers that linked to it, asking friends and more.
