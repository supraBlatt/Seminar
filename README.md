# Seminar
**A university 3rd year seminar** about using personalization to ease the life of users.
This seminar was presented in BIU, in May 2022 under Osher Yadgar.

I paraphrased, edited, explained and presented the technical portions of the paper. It involved researching material online, reading and crossing information from other related papers and papers that linked to it, asking friends and more.
